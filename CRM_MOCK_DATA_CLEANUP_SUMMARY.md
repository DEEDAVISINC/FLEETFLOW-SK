## 📋 **For Future Database Integration**

When you're ready to add real CRM data:

1. **Set up Supabase database**
2. **Add credentials to `.env.local`:**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-actual-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-supabase-key
   ```
3. **Create CRM tables using the schema**
