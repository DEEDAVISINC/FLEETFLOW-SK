## What's New

### **Lead Nurture Mastery Knowledge Base**

Location: `app/services/LeadNurtureMasteryKnowledgeBase.ts`

A comprehensive knowledge base containing:

- **75+ actionable strategies** across 6 categories
- **Deal velocity metrics and benchmarks**

**Formula:** `(Opportunities × Win Rate × Deal Size) / Sales Cycle Length`

**Targets by Segment:**

- **Fast-Track:** 7-day close (high-intent, ICP-matched leads)
- **Standard:** 21-day close (qualified mid-market)
- **Enterprise:** 45-day close (large fleets, complex deals)

**Stage Velocity Targets:**

```
Time to First Touch:    5-15 minutes
Time to Meeting:        24-72 hours
Time in Stage:          2-7 days
Proposal to Close:      7-21 days
```

---

### 2. **Six Strategy Categories**

#### **CRM Momentum Strategies** (3 strategies)

- Minimum viable fields for routing
- Duplicate detection & account matching
- No silent failures policy

#### **Speed-to-Lead Strategies** (3 strategies)

- Instant scheduling on thank-you pages
- 5-minute SLA for high-intent leads
- Behavioral routing & context transfer

#### **Qualification Frameworks** (3 strategies)

### 3. **Transportation-Specific Adaptations**

#### **Fleet Size Fast Qualification**

Quickly segment leads by fleet size for proper routing:

- **<10 trucks:** Small fleet specialist → Fast-track (7-14 days)
- **10-50 trucks:** Mid-market rep → Standard (21 days)
- **50-200 trucks:** Enterprise rep → Extended (30-45 days)
- **200+ trucks:** Strategic accounts → Custom

Address common concerns upfront:

#### **Urgent Deadline Fast-Track**

Prioritize leads with immediate needs:

- DOT audit deadlines

## How AI Staff Use This Knowledge

### **Automatic Context-Aware Guidance**

When AI staff interact with leads, they automatically receive:

**Scenario 1: High-Urgency Lead**

```typescript
{
  suggestedStrategies: ['Urgent Compliance Deadline Fast-Track'],
  talkingPoints: [
    'Ask about upcoming deadlines: DOT audit, insurance renewal',
    'Offer expedited onboarding (operational in 7 days)',
    'Provide compliance kit immediately'
  ],
  expectedOutcome: 'Fast-track deal with compressed cycle (7-14 days)'
}
```

**Scenario 2: Pricing Page Visitor**

```typescript
{
  suggestedStrategies: ['Behavioral Routing & Context Transfer'],
  talkingPoints: [
    'Lead is price-conscious; start with ROI conversation',
    'Reference pricing page visit naturally',
    'Share relevant case study with ROI metrics'
  ],
  expectedOutcome: 'Price-focused conversation leading to value alignment'
}
```

**Scenario 3: Large Fleet (Enterprise)**

```typescript
{
  suggestedStrategies: ['Fast-Track Lane', 'Procurement-Ready Kit'],
  talkingPoints: [
    'Identify multiple stakeholders early',
    'Propose Mutual Action Plan to navigate enterprise process',
    'Offer procurement-ready kit for legal/security review'
  ],
  expectedOutcome: 'Enterprise deal with MAP (21-45 day cycle)'
}
```

```typescript
// Based on current deal metrics
const recommendations = leadNurtureMastery.getVelocityRecommendations({
  timeToFirstTouch: 15,      // 15 minutes (slow)

  proposalToClose: 21,       // 3 weeks (acceptable)
  overallCycleLength: 45     // 45 days (needs improvement)
});

// Returns prioritized strategies to improve these metrics
```

### **Integration with Adaptive Learning**

```typescript
import { getLeadNurturingGuidance } from './utils/learningTriggers';
