    (Wait for deployment to complete - usually 2-5 minutes)

    ✓ Shows opt-in language
    ✓ Shows STOP instructions
    ✓ Shows contact info
    ✓ File size under 5MB

[ ] STEP 6: SEND EMAIL
    Open: TWILIO_REPLY_WITH_SCREENSHOT.txt
    Copy the email content
    Paste into email to Uzi
    ATTACH the screenshot
    Send!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

If page redirects to login:
→ Middleware didn't deploy properly
→ Check Digital Ocean deployment logs
→ Verify middleware.ts includes '/sms-consent' in PUBLIC_PAGES

If screenshot is too large:
→ Use image compression tool
→ Or use lower quality setting
→ Keep under 5MB for email

If Twilio still can't access:
→ Check Digital Ocean firewall settings
→ Verify domain DNS is pointing correctly
→ Try accessing from different network to confirm

READY TO GO?
============
Once ALL checkboxes are checked above, send the email!

Estimated time: 10-15 minutes total
