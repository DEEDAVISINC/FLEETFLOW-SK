## üìä STEP 2: COST CALCULATION

### **Direct Labor:**

**Drivers:**

- Loads/day: 50
- Hours per load cycle: 4 hours (50 miles @ 12.5 mph avg)
- Loads per driver/day: 2.5
- Drivers needed: 50 √∑ 2.5 = **20 drivers** ‚Üí rounds to **9 drivers** (realistic)
- Hours/month: 9 drivers √ó 176 hours = **1,584 hours**
- Wage: $25/hour (BLS median for Michigan)
- Base pay: 1,584 √ó $25 = **$39,600/month**
- Fringe (30%): **$11,880/month**
- **Total: $51,480/month**

**Dispatchers:**

- Need: 1 dispatcher per 15-20 drivers
- 9 drivers √∑ 15 = **2 dispatchers**
- Hours: 2 √ó 176 = 352 hours
- Wage: $30/hour
- Base pay: **$10,560/month**
- Fringe: **$3,168/month**
- **Total: $13,728/month**

### **Direct Materials:**

**Fuel:**

- Miles/month: 50 loads/day √ó 22 days √ó 50 miles = **55,000 miles**
- MPG: 6.5 (loaded dump truck)
- Gallons: 55,000 √∑ 6.5 = **8,462 gallons**
- Price: $3.80/gallon (DOE current Michigan average)
- **Total: $32,155/month**

**Supplies:**

- Maintenance supplies: $500
- Safety equipment: $300

### **Subcontractors:**

- Contracted maintenance: $3,000/month

- **Total: $4,500/month**

**Total Direct Costs: $110,871/month**

### **Indirect Costs (Overhead):**

- Rate: 37.8% of Direct Labor
- $73,216 √ó 0.378 = **$27,700/month**

### **Total Cost:**

- $110,871 + $27,700 = **$138,571/month**

### **Profit:**

Using FAR 15.404-4 Weighted Guidelines:

- Base profit: 10.0%
- FFP risk premium: +2.0%
- **Total profit rate: 12.0%**
- $138,571 √ó 0.12 = **$16,628/month**

### **Total Price:**

- $138,571 + $16,628 = **$155,199/month**

**Annual:** $1,862,388

**Per Load:** $155,199 √∑ 1,100 = **$141.09/load**

## üéØ STEP 3: PRICING STRATEGY

### **Evaluation Method: LPTA** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Market Comparison:**

- Spot market average: $95/load
- Your calculated price: $141.09/load
- **Difference: +48.5% above market**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è COMPETITIVE RISK: HIGH**

**System Recommendations:**

1. **DECLINE TO BID (Recommended if unprofitable at market rates)**
   - Market rate ($95/load) is below your cost ($126/load)
   - You would lose money on every load

2. **REDUCE COSTS to compete:**
   - Switch to broker model (coordinate carriers vs own trucks)
   - Use owner-operators vs W-2 drivers
   - Reduce overhead allocation
   - **Target price: $100-110/load to be competitive**

3. **PARTNER with lower-cost provider:**
   - Subcontract actual hauling
   - Focus on dispatch/coordination value-add

### **Strategic Decision:**

**For LPTA:** You MUST be the lowest price to win. Your current cost structure cannot compete
profitably.

**Options:**

- **Decline bid** (recommended)
- **Restructure costs** (broker model, reduce overhead)
- **Partner with asset carrier** (subcontract hauling)

## üîÑ COMPARISON: BEST VALUE SCENARIO

**What if evaluation method was Best Value instead of LPTA?**

**Evaluation Factors:**

- Technical: 40%
- Past Performance: 30%
- Price: 30%

**System Analysis:**

### **Competitive Risk: LOW** ‚úÖ

**Recommendations:**

- ‚úÖ Best Value with price at 30% allows premium pricing for quality
- Submit at calculated price: $141.09/load
- **Strong value justification:**
  - WOSB certification (diversity goals)
  - FleetFlow‚Ñ¢ technology (real-time tracking)
  - 99.8% on-time delivery rate
  - Zero safety violations
  - W-2 employed drivers (consistent quality)

**Pricing Strategy:** "Your 48% premium over spot market is JUSTIFIED by superior quality,
reliability, and socioeconomic value. Focus technical proposal on differentiators."

**Decision: SUBMIT BID with confidence!**

---

## üéØ KEY TAKEAWAY

**Same cost structure, different evaluation methods = completely different strategy!**

- **LPTA:** Must be lowest price ‚Üí Decline or restructure
- **Best Value:** Can justify premium ‚Üí Submit with value emphasis

**The Government Pricing System analyzes BOTH cost AND strategy to help you make smart decisions!**
