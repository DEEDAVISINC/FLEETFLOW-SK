## 📋 TWO CONTRACT SYSTEMS

### **1. Platform Contract (FleetFlow ↔ Tenant)**

**Purpose**: Software subscription  
**File**: `FLEETFLOW_PLATFORM_TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md`  
**Parties**:
- FleetFlow TMS LLC (Platform Provider)
- Tenant (Freight Forwarder/Broker)

**Key Terms**:
- Monthly subscription: $299-$1,999
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Data ownership: Tenant owns their data
- Liability: Limited to 12 months fees
- Termination: 30 days notice

### **2. Freight Service Contract (Tenant ↔ Client)**

**Purpose**: Freight forwarding services  
**File**: `FreightForwarderContractTemplates.ts`  
**Parties**:
- Tenant (Using FleetFlow software)
- Tenant's Client (Shipper/Consignee)

**Key Terms**:
- COGSA liability limits ($500/package)
- Montreal Convention (air freight)
- Force majeure protection
- Client indemnification (unlimited)
- Payment terms: NET 30 + 1.5% late fee

---

## 💰 REVENUE MODEL

### **FleetFlow Revenue (From Tenants)**

**Subscription Plans**:
| Plan | Monthly | Per Shipment | Setup | Users | Max Shipments |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|-------|---------------|
| STARTER | $299 | $5 | $0 | 3 | 100 |
| PROFESSIONAL | $799 | $3 | $500 | 10 | 500 |
| ENTERPRISE | $1,999 | $1 | $1,500 | Unlimited | Unlimited |

**Example Annual Revenue**:
- 100 tenants × $799/month = $958,800/year (base)
- Plus transaction fees
- Plus setup fees
- **Projected: $1.2M+ ARR with 100 tenants**

### **Tenant Revenue (From Their Clients)**

**Example: Tenant provides 40ft container service**:
```
Client pays Tenant: $3,250 (ocean freight + services)
Tenant pays Carrier: $2,400 (container cost)
Tenant pays FleetFlow: $799/month + $3/shipment
Tenant pays Customs Broker: $200

TENANT PROFIT: ~$647 per shipment

If tenant handles 200 shipments/month:
• Monthly revenue: $650,000
• Monthly costs: ~$488,000
• Monthly profit: ~$162,000
• Profit margin: ~25%

FleetFlow earns: $799 + (200 × $3) = $1,399/month
Tenant earns: ~$162,000/month
```

---

## 🔐 MULTI-TENANT DATA ISOLATION

### **Database Schema Isolation**:

Every table includes `tenant_id`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ff_contacts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,  -- ← ISOLATES DATA
  contact_code VARCHAR(15),
  company_name VARCHAR(255),
  -- ... fields
  INDEX idx_tenant (tenant_id),
  UNIQUE (tenant_id, contact_code)
);

-- Row Level Security (PostgreSQL)
ALTER TABLE ff_contacts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON ff_contacts
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::UUID);
```

### **What This Ensures**:
✅ Tenant A cannot see Tenant B's contacts  
✅ Tenant A cannot see Tenant B's shipments  
✅ Tenant A cannot see Tenant B's contracts  
✅ Complete data isolation at database level  
✅ PostgreSQL Row Level Security enforced
