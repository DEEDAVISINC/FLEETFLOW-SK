# Bid Management Features Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ 1. Enhanced Console Logging for Debugging

**STATUS: COMPLETED**

### Changes Made:

- **File**: `app/freightflow-rfx/page.tsx` (lines 1420-1479)
- Added detailed console logging for bid auto-save operations
- Logs include: documentName, solicitationId, contactEmail, method (CREATE/UPDATE), timestamp
- HTTP error detection with status codes
- Success/failure logging with structured data
- User-friendly error alerts

### What This Does:

- Every time a bid is saved, detailed debug info appears in browser console
- If the "Stone solicitation" failed to save, the console will now show exactly why
- Helps diagnose any future save failures immediately

## ‚úÖ 2. Recently Deleted / Trash Feature with Recovery

**STATUS: 95% COMPLETE - NEEDS SQL MIGRATION**

### Backend API Updates:

**File**: `app/api/rfx-bids/route.ts`

1. **GET Endpoint** (lines 37-122):
   - Added `?trash=true` parameter to fetch deleted bids
   - Default behavior: returns only non-deleted bids (`deleted_at IS NULL`)
   - Trash view: returns only deleted bids (`deleted_at IS NOT NULL`)

2. **DELETE Endpoint** (lines 285-418):
   - **Soft Delete** (default): Moves bid to trash, sets `deleted_at` timestamp
   - **Restore** (`?restore=true`): Recovers bid from trash, clears `deleted_at`
   - **Permanent Delete** (`?permanent=true`): Permanently removes bid from database (requires
     double confirmation)

### Frontend UI Updates:

**File**: `app/freightflow-rfx/page.tsx`

1. **State Management** (lines 104-106):

   ```typescript
   const [trashBids, setTrashBids] = useState<any[]>([]);
   const [loadingTrash, setLoadingTrash] = useState(false);
   const [showTrash, setShowTrash] = useState(false);
   ```

2. **Functions Added** (lines 391-505):
   - `fetchTrashBids()`: Fetches deleted bids from API
   - `moveBidToTrash(bidId)`: Soft delete with confirmation
   - `restoreBidFromTrash(bidId)`: Recover deleted bid
   - `permanentlyDeleteBid(bidId)`: Permanently delete with double confirmation

3. **UI Components** (lines 5745-5798):
   - "View Trash" / "View My Bids" toggle button
   - Conditional table headers based on view (trash vs active)
   - Different action buttons for trash (Restore, Delete Forever) vs active (View, Send, Delete)

### Database Schema:

**File**: `scripts/add-soft-delete-to-rfx-bids.sql` ‚ú® NEW FILE

- Adds `deleted_at` and `deleted_by` columns
- Creates indexes for efficient querying
- Creates views for active and trash bids
- Adds cleanup function for bids older than 30 days
- **‚ö†Ô∏è MUST BE RUN IN SUPABASE before feature works**

### How It Works:

1. User clicks üóëÔ∏è button next to a bid ‚Üí Bid moves to trash (30-day retention)
2. User clicks "View Trash" ‚Üí See all recently deleted bids
3. User can "Restore" bid ‚Üí Bid returns to My Bids
4. User can "Delete Forever" ‚Üí Permanent deletion (double confirmation required)
5. After 30 days, deleted bids can be auto-cleaned up (manual function provided)

## üîÑ 3. Export/Backup Feature (IN PROGRESS)

**STATUS: NEXT**

### Planned Features:

1. **Export Single Bid**:
   - Download as Markdown (.md)
   - Download as HTML
   - Copy to clipboard

2. **Export All Bids**:
   - Bulk export as ZIP file
   - Individual files for each bid
   - Organized by date/customer

3. **Auto-Backup**:
   - Optional: Auto-save bids to local file system
   - Export summary report with all bid metadata

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Run SQL Migration**:

   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
   -- /Users/deedavis/FLEETFLOW/scripts/add-soft-delete-to-rfx-bids.sql
   ```

2. **Test Trash Feature**:
   - Create a test bid
   - Move it to trash
   - Verify it appears in trash view
   - Restore it
   - Verify it returns to My Bids

3. **Implement Export Feature** (Feature #3)

4. **Complete Trash UI** (minor):
   - The bid row rendering needs slight update for trash view
   - Grid columns are already set up correctly
   - Just need to finalize the conditional rendering

## üìä Testing Checklist

### Enhanced Logging:

- [ ] Open browser console
- [ ] Analyze an RFP/RFQ
- [ ] Check console for detailed save logs
- [ ] Verify timestamps and metadata

### Trash Feature:

- [ ] Run SQL migration in Supabase
- [ ] Create a test bid
- [ ] Delete the bid (should move to trash)
- [ ] Click "View Trash"
- [ ] Verify bid appears with delete date
- [ ] Click "Restore"
- [ ] Verify bid returns to My Bids
- [ ] Delete again, then "Delete Forever"
- [ ] Verify permanent deletion with double confirm

### Export Feature (TODO):

- [ ] Export single bid as Markdown
- [ ] Export single bid as HTML
- [ ] Export all bids as ZIP
- [ ] Verify file contents match bid data

## üîß Technical Notes

### Why Soft Deletes?

- **User Safety**: Accidental deletions can be recovered
- **Audit Trail**: Track when/who deleted bids
- **Data Retention**: Compliance with record-keeping requirements
- **Better UX**: "Undo" functionality for mistakes

### 30-Day Retention Policy:

- Industry standard (similar to email trash)
- Balances data retention with database size
- Automatic cleanup function provided (manual trigger)
- Can be extended if needed

### Performance Considerations:

- Indexes created on `deleted_at` for fast queries
- Separate views prevent filtering overhead
- Soft deletes don't impact active bid queries

   - View bid history
   - Restore previous versions

4. **Collaboration**:
   - Share bids with team members
   - Comments/notes on bids
   - Approval workflows
