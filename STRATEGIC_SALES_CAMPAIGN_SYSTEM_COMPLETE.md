## 🔍 Research-Driven Messaging

All messages are based on **real customer pain points** from industry research:

### **Freight Broker Example:**

**Pain Point:** "Shippers are asking for real-time tracking on every load, but only 40% of our
carriers provide updates consistently"

**Message (Research-Driven):**

```
Subject: The $75K visibility gap costing freight brokers

Hi [Name],

With [Company]'s growth to 75 trucks, you're probably facing the same challenge as [Similar Broker] mentioned: "Leadership approved our TMS budget, but when only 40% of loads have real-time tracking, customers start questioning the spend."

Here's what changed everything for [Similar Broker]: Instead of asking carriers to manually update load status, we built AI-powered tracking that pulls data directly from their systems.

Result: 94% real-time visibility, with customers specifically telling leadership it was their favorite new feature.

Would you like to see how we could replicate this for [Company]'s operations?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
