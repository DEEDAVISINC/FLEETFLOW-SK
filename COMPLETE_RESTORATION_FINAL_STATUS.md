## 🚀 **HOW THE RESTORATION WAS COMPLETED**

**Problem:** The `freight-forwarders/page.tsx` file was 1,675 lines, too large for direct inline edits.

**Solution:** Created `DeniedPartyScreeningUI.tsx` as a separate component:
1. Created `/app/components/DeniedPartyScreeningUI.tsx` (complete UI)
2. Imported into `freight-forwarders/page.tsx`
3. Replaced placeholder with component usage
4. Passed all required props (parties, results, handlers)

**Result:** Clean separation of concerns, maintainable code, full functionality restored.
