PLACEHOLDER ICON FILES NEEDED

The Chrome extension requires three icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
For testing, you can use any PNG files with these names and dimensions.

QUICK FIX:
1. Go to https://www.canva.com or any image editor
2. Create 3 square images with a ship emoji ðŸš¢ on blue background
3. Export as icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
4. Place them in this directory

Or download any placeholder icons and rename them.

The extension will work without these if you comment out the "icons" and "action.default_icon" sections in manifest.json temporarily.
