## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts Integrated

### **1. Prospecting Philosophy**

```
"Aim small, miss small"
- Focus on specific region, market, or industry
- Don't cast a wide net
- Build brand essentials first
```

### **2. Pre-Call Preparation**

```
"You can't call a shipper empty-handed"
Required research:
- Current rates for the lane
- Cost to get a truck
- Market conditions (supply vs demand)
- Load-to-truck ratios
```

### **3. New Broker Advantages**

```
Turn "disadvantages" into strengths:
- Single point of contact â†’ White-glove service
- Small size â†’ Flexibility and agility
- No track record â†’ Competitive pricing
- Solo operation â†’ Custom service options
```

### **4. Cold Calling Technique**

```
"Being likable sells"
Physical tactics:
- Stand up during calls
- Smile while speaking
- Walk as you talk
- Use a mirror to remember to smile

Closing question:
"Do you have truckloads I can handle for you?"
```

### **5. Sustainable Growth**

```
"Grow a reputation, not just a business"
- Grow to manageable size
- Then double down on customer service
- Word-of-mouth beats rapid acquisition
- Trust and reliability separate you from pack
```

### **6. Strategic Losses**

```
"Don't be afraid to take a loss"
- Preserve relationships over short-term profit
- Trust and history create long-term rewards
- Small broker agility is competitive advantage
- Calculated risk leads to bigger profits
```

### **7. Technology Transition**

```
"One typo away from crashing"
- Spreadsheets are risky
- TMS = "brokerage-in-a-box"
- Purpose-built for brokers, not repurposed shipper solution
- Grow business, not back office
```

- Negotiate with solid footing

RateView:
