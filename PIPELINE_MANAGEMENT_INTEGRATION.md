## The Core Framework

### Mark Kosoglow's 5-Stage Sales Process

A clear, measurable process where every stage has:

- **Seminal Question:** What you're trying to answer
- **Exit Criteria:** Proof that you've answered the question
- **People Involved:** Who should answer that question
- **Tools:** Things you can do to get the answer
- **Risk Criteria:** How well you've achieved the exit criteria

---

## Stage 1: Problem Agreement

**Seminal Question:** Do they have a problem we can solve?

**Exit Criteria:**

- ✅ 2-3 business initiatives identified (not just problems or projects)
- ✅ Understand the org structure (321: 3 peers, 2 managers, 1 executive)
- ✅ Confirmed pain points related to current operations
- ✅ Identified decision-making process

**People Involved:** Director Sales, Business Development Rep

**Tools:**

- Discovery Call with structured questions
- Problem Hypothesis (what we think their issues are)
- Audits / Comparisons (current state vs ideal state)
- Demo showing Before vs After scenarios

**Risk Criteria:**

- 🟢 **Initiative** - Clear business initiatives tied to company goals
- 🟡 **Problem** - Acknowledge problems but no formal initiatives
- 🟠 **Pain** - Some pain mentioned but not prioritized
- 🛑 **No Pain** - No real problem identified

**Transportation Adaptation:**

- Identify current dispatch/TMS pain points (manual processes, inefficiency)
- Understand fleet size and growth plans
- Confirm compliance challenges (DOT, ELD, IFTA)
- Map current technology stack and gaps

---

## Stage 2: Priority Agreement

**Seminal Question:** Are the problems big enough to prioritize solving?

**Exit Criteria:**

- ✅ Quantified business initiatives with metrics ($, time, efficiency)
- ✅ Implementation date or timeline established
- ✅ Budget implications understood
- ✅ Project prioritization confirmed (top 3 initiatives)

**People Involved:** Director Sales, VP Operations or higher

**Tools:**

- Value engineering session (ROI calculator)
- Super detailed demos (before vs after workflows)
- Workflow interviews / reverse demos
- Case study from similar company/fleet size

**Risk Criteria:**

- 🟢 **Massive Metrics** - Clear, quantified impact with executive sponsorship
- 🟡 **Clear Metrics** - Quantified but not tied to strategic initiatives
- 🟠 **Not Meaningful** - Metrics exist but impact is marginal
- 🛑 **No Metrics** - Cannot quantify value or impact

**Transportation Adaptation:**

- Quantified cost of current inefficiencies ($/month lost to manual work)
- Calculated time savings from automation (hours/week)
- Established ROI timeline (payback period)
- Confirmed budget availability and fiscal calendar

---

## Stage 3: Evaluation Agreement

**Seminal Question:** Will they agree on how to buy?

**Exit Criteria:**

- ✅ Mutual Action Plan (MAP) in place with dates and owners
- ✅ Required capabilities documented and agreed upon
- ✅ Evaluation criteria defined (what constitutes success)
- ✅ Stakeholder alignment confirmed
- ✅ Competitive landscape understood

**People Involved:** Director Sales, CRO/VP Sales, Champion

**Tools:**

- Champion 1:1 meetings (build internal advocate)
- Executive meetings (align with C-level on strategy)
- Case studies (proof points for decision committee)
- Mutual Action Plan template

**Risk Criteria:**

- 🟢 **Influence Eval Criteria** - We helped define how they evaluate
- 🟡 **Clear Eval Criteria** - They have criteria but we didn't influence it
- 🟠 **Minimal Eval Criteria** - Vague criteria or not formalized
- 🛑 **No Eval Criteria** - No clear decision process

**Transportation Adaptation:**

- MAP includes: Operations Manager, CFO, IT contact
- Integration requirements documented (ELD, accounting system)
- Data migration plan agreed upon
- Training and onboarding timeline defined

---

## Stage 4: Value Agreement

**Seminal Question:** Is this solution worth putting money into?

**Exit Criteria:**

- ✅ Approved proposal above the line
- ✅ Passed procurement and security review
- ✅ Budget allocated or identified
- ✅ ROI/business case accepted by finance
- ✅ Technical validation complete

**People Involved:** Director Sales, CRO/VP Sales, IT, Finance

**Tools:**

- Super detailed demos (show exact workflows)
- Pilots & Trials (test before buying)
- Business cases / ROI studies
- Reference calls with similar customers

**Risk Criteria:**

- 🟢 **Big ROI + Exclusive** - Clear ROI, we're the only solution considered
- 🟡 **Big ROI** - Strong ROI but competitive evaluation in progress
- 🟠 **Some ROI** - Marginal ROI or unclear financial impact
- 🛑 **No ROI** - Cannot demonstrate clear financial return

**Transportation Adaptation:**

- Pilot successful or ROI calculator approved
- IT security and compliance review complete
- Pricing approved by finance
- Implementation resources confirmed

---

## Stage 5: Commercial Agreement

**Seminal Question:** Are you gonna buy this thing?

**Exit Criteria:**

- ✅ Executed contract (signed by all parties)
- ✅ Notes to post-sales team (handoff documentation)
- ✅ Payment terms agreed
- ✅ Implementation kickoff scheduled
- ✅ Success criteria defined for onboarding

**People Involved:** Director Sales, CRO/VP Sales, IT, Finance, Legal

**Tools:**

- Discounts & negotiation
- DocuSign or contract management system

**Risk Criteria:**

- 🟢 **They're Driving** - Customer is pushing to get deal done
- 🟡 **We're Driving** - We're managing timeline and follow-ups
- 🟠 **Falling Behind** - Timeline slipping, losing momentum
- 🛑 **Nothing Started** - No movement toward contract execution

**Transportation Adaptation:**

- Contract signed by authorized signatory
- Payment method and terms confirmed
- Implementation kickoff scheduled
- Success metrics defined (KPIs for first 90 days)

---

## Deal Review Methodology (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Verify Deal Data

Confirm the basics out loud to ensure accuracy.

**Example:**

> "You've got a $75k opportunity with ABC Trucking in Evaluation Agreement (Stage 3), with prior
> stages exit criteria met. Is that correct?"

**What to Check:**

- Account name
- Expected ARR
- Close date
- Current stage
- Prior stage exit criteria completion

---

### Step 2: Assess Forecast Risk

Poke holes in three critical areas:

#### A. Opportunity Details

Look for discrepancies in deal size and velocity.

**Red Flags:**

- Super big deal size + unusually quick timeline
- Large ARR with short relationship history
- Enterprise deal moving through stages too fast

**Example Questions:**

- "This is a $200k deal closing in 30 days - walk me through why they're moving this fast"
- "What's driving the urgency? Is it real or are we pushing?"

#### B. Exit Criteria

Confirm they've actually gotten the exit criteria, not just completed activities.

**Key Distinction:**

- ❌ "We ran a discovery call" (activity)
- ✅ "We got problem agreement on 3 business initiatives" (exit criteria)

**Example Questions:**

- "You say you're in Priority Agreement - show me the quantified business initiatives"
- "What's the implementation date they committed to?"

#### C. Risk Assessment

Reps often assess risk incorrectly. Validate their risk rating.

**Risk Validation:**

- 🟢 Green = 90%+ exit criteria met, timeline solid, champion driving
- 🟡 Yellow = 70%+ criteria met, some risks but manageable
- 🟠 Orange = 50-70% criteria met, significant risk of push
- 🛑 Red = <50% criteria met, deal at risk of loss

**Example Questions:**

- "You marked this green, but we haven't completed the MAP - why green?"
- "What specific risks exist and how are we mitigating them?"

---

### Step 3: Plan Next Steps

Define the exit criteria needed next and confirm there's a meeting set to achieve it.

**Critical Requirement:** Not just a "touchpoint" - a meeting with purpose and stakeholders.

**Example:**

- ❌ "I'll follow up next week" (vague touchpoint)
- ✅ "VP Operations meeting Tuesday to review ROI calc and set implementation date" (exit criteria
  meeting)

**Planning Template:**

- **Next Exit Criteria Needed:** [Specific criteria from next stage]
- **Meeting Type:** [Discovery, ROI review, executive alignment, etc.]
- **Stakeholders:** [Who must attend]
- **Timeframe:** [When scheduled - must have date]

---

## 3-Step Forecasting Process

### Step 1: Categorize Deals by Risk

**Rule:** If deal has timeline + clear business initiative = It's in play for forecast

Then assess risk to determine forecast inclusion:

| Risk Level | Category         | Forecast? | Definition                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🛑         | Best Case (Lose) | ❌ No     | Deal is lost if you can't overcome the risk    |
| 🟠         | Best Case (Push) | ❌ No     | Deal likely to push if you can't mitigate risk |
| 🟡         | Best Case (Win)  | ✅ Yes    | Deal has risk you can overcome                 |
| 🟢         | Commit (Lock)    | ✅ Yes    | Deal has little to no risk remaining           |

---

### Step 2: Build Forecast (3-Component Formula)

```
Forecast = (🟢 Commit Lock) + (🟡 Best Case Win) + (Average Create & Close)
```

**Component Breakdown:**

1. **🟢 Commit (Lock)** - Deals with 90%+ exit criteria met, closing within 14 days
2. **🟡 Best Case (Win)** - Deals with 70%+ exit criteria met, manageable risks
3. **📊 Average Create & Close** - Historical average of deals created and closed in-quarter

**Example:**

```typescript
Commit Lock: $250k (2 deals)
Best Case Win: $400k (4 deals)
Create & Close: $150k (historical average)
─────────────────────────
Total Forecast: $800k
```

---

### Step 3: Build Plan to Close Gap

**Gap = Goal - Forecast**

**Example:**

- Goal: $1M
- Forecast: $800k
- Gap: $200k (20% shortfall)

**5 Sources to Close the Gap:**

#### 1. 🛑 Best Case (Lose) Deals

**Strategy:** Run creative plays to turn these around

**Tactics:**

- Get executives involved (CEO/CRO call with prospect executive)
- Offer pilot or proof-of-concept to reduce risk
- Bring in customer reference for peer validation
- Address specific objections with subject matter experts

**Pipeline Available:** Review all Red deals, prioritize highest ARR

---

#### 2. 🟠 Best Case (Push) Deals

**Strategy:** Mitigate risks to prevent timeline slippage

**Tactics:**

- Remove blockers (legal, security, procurement)
- Build urgency through business value/cost of delay
- Engage champion to drive internal momentum
- Simplify scope if needed to accelerate

**Pipeline Available:** All Orange deals in current quarter

---

#### 3. 📊 Pipeline from This Quarter

**Strategy:** Accelerate early stage deals into forecast

**Tactics:**

- Find business initiatives tied to strategic goals
- Identify timeline drivers (compliance deadlines, contract expirations)
- Quantify ROI to build urgency
- Fast-track through stages with condensed discovery

**Pipeline Available:** Stage 1-2 deals with strong fit

---

#### 4. ➡️ Pull-in from Future Quarters

**Strategy:** Accelerate deals slated for next quarter

**Tactics:**

- Offer incentive for earlier commitment (discount, priority implementation)
- Highlight cost of waiting (price increase, competitive risk)
- Connect earlier close to their business timeline
- Provide additional value for accelerated decision

**Pipeline Available:** Q2 committed deals that could move to Q1

---

#### 5. 📞 More Create & Close

**Strategy:** Generate new deals that close in-quarter

**Tactics:**

- Target warm inbound leads with high intent signals
- Reach out to past opportunities that didn't close
- Leverage customer referrals for warm introductions
- Focus on fast-close segments (small fleets, urgent compliance)

**Pipeline Available:** Net new opportunities + revival candidates

---

## Integration with Adaptive Learning

AI staff automatically:

1. **Analyze pipeline health** based on stage progression
2. **Identify at-risk deals** using exit criteria gaps
3. **Recommend mitigation strategies** for specific risks
4. **Generate deal review questions** for managers
5. **Calculate forecast accuracy** and learn from outcomes

**Example: Desiree Reviewing $125k Deal**

```typescript
AI Analysis:
✅ Stage: Value Agreement (Stage 4)
⚠️ Exit Criteria: 60% complete (3 of 5)
⚠️ Risk: Yellow (Best Case Win)
✅ In Forecast: Yes
⚠️ Days to Close: 27 days

Recommended Actions:
1. Complete ROI/business case approval (missing criteria)
2. Expedite security review (blocker)
3. Schedule finance approval meeting this week
4. Build urgency through implementation timeline

Deal Review Script:
"Walk me through the $125k ABC Trucking deal. You're in Value Agreement but only 60% of exit criteria are met with 27 days to close. What specifically is blocking the security review, and do we have a meeting scheduled with finance this week?"
```
