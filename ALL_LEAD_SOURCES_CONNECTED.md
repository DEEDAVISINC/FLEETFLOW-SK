## 🎯 Lead Source Architecture

Your Depointe AI campaigns now pull from **THREE real data sources**:

### 1. 🕷️ **TruckingPlanet Network (70K+ Shippers)**

- **Method:** Web scraping (Puppeteer)
- **Data:** High-volume shippers, carriers, brokers
- **Use Case:** Shipper Expansion, Generic leads
- **Login:** DEE DAVIS INC account
- **Process:** Logs into website → scrapes HTML → returns structured data
- **API Route:** `/api/scrape/truckingplanet`

### 2. 🏛️ **FMCSA Government Database**

- **Method:** Carrier analysis → shipper intelligence
- **Data:** DOT/MC carrier relationships, shipping patterns
- **Use Case:** Healthcare logistics, pharmaceutical shippers
- **Process:** Analyzes carrier data → reverse-engineers shipper relationships
- **New Method:** `searchShippers()` - simplified search API

### 3. 🏭 **ThomasNet Industrial Database**

- **Method:** Manufacturer database queries
- **Data:** Industrial manufacturers, production companies
- **Use Case:** Desperate prospects, manufacturers needing shipping
- **Process:** Searches manufacturers → filters by freight score
- **New Method:** `searchHighPotentialManufacturers()` - simplified search API

## 📊 Campaign Type → Data Source Mapping

| Campaign Type            | Primary Source | Secondary Source | What You Get                       |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Healthcare Logistics** | FMCSA          | ThomasNet        | Pharma shippers, medical logistics |
| **Shipper Expansion**    | TruckingPlanet | FMCSA            | High-volume verified shippers      |
| **Desperate Prospects**  | ThomasNet      | FMCSA            | Manufacturers + urgent shippers    |
| **Generic**              | TruckingPlanet | -                | General freight prospects          |

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem:

- Services existed but had **missing methods**
- `DEPOINTETaskExecutionService` was calling methods that didn't exist:
  - `fmcsaService.searchShippers()` ❌
  - `thomasNetService.searchHighPotentialManufacturers()` ❌
- This caused errors and fallback to 100% mock data

### Solution:

**Added missing methods to both services:**

#### ✅ FMCSAShipperIntelligenceService:

```typescript
async searchShippers(criteria: {
  industry?: string[];
  minAnnualShipments?: number;
  location?: string;
  limit?: number;
}): Promise<ShipperIntelligence[]>
```

#### ✅ ThomasNetAutomationService:

```typescript
async searchHighPotentialManufacturers(criteria: {
  minFreightScore?: number;
  industry?: string;
  state?: string;
  limit?: number;
}): Promise<ManufacturerData[]>
```

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Lead Generation Flow:

```
Campaign Deployed
     ↓
DEPOINTETaskExecutionService.generateLeadsForTask()
     ↓
Based on campaign type:
     ├─ Healthcare → FMCSA.searchShippers({ industry: ['pharmaceutical', 'medical'] })
     ├─ Shipper → TruckingPlanet.searchShippers({ freightVolume: 'high' })
     └─ Desperate → ThomasNet.searchHighPotentialManufacturers({ minFreightScore: 70 })
     ↓
Real data returned from services
     ↓
Mapped to Lead interface
     ↓
Stored in localStorage: 'depointe-crm-leads'
     ↓
Displayed in CRM & Leads tab
```

## 🧪 Testing All Sources

### 1. **Clear Old Data**

```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.removeItem('depointe-crm-leads');
localStorage.removeItem('depointe-activity-feed');
```

### 2. **Test Each Campaign Type:**

#### Healthcare Campaign:

- Deploy "Grant Acquisition" or custom healthcare campaign
- **Expected console logs:**
  ```
  🔍 Searching FMCSA for shippers: {industry: ['pharmaceutical', 'medical', 'healthcare']}
  ✅ Found 25 matching shippers from FMCSA
  📋 Generated 25 REAL leads for task: Healthcare Outreach from FMCSA
  ```

#### Shipper Campaign:

- Deploy "Shipper Expansion"
- **Expected console logs:**
  ```
  🕷️ Starting TruckingPlanet web scrape...
  ✅ LIVE SCRAPE: Retrieved 30 REAL shippers from TruckingPlanet
  📋 Generated 30 REAL leads for task: Shipper Expansion from TruckingPlanet
  ```

#### Desperate Prospects Campaign:

- Deploy "Desperate Prospects Batch"
- **Expected console logs:**
  ```
  🔍 Searching ThomasNet for high-potential manufacturers: {minFreightScore: 70}
  ✅ Found 15 high-potential manufacturers from ThomasNet
  🔍 Searching FMCSA for shippers...
  ✅ Found 15 matching shippers from FMCSA
  📋 Generated 30 REAL leads (mixed sources)
  ```

### 3. **Verify in CRM:**

- Go to "CRM & Leads" tab
- Check lead IDs:
  - `TP-LIVE-X` = TruckingPlanet (web scraped)
  - `LEAD-XXXXXXXXX` = FMCSA or ThomasNet
- Company names should be realistic (not "Mock Company 1")

## 📋 Lead ID Patterns

| Source         | ID Format                   | Example                  |

| TruckingPlanet | `TP-LIVE-X`                 | `TP-LIVE-1`, `TP-LIVE-2` |
