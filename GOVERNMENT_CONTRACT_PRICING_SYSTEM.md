# 🏛️ GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING SYSTEM

**FleetFlow's Intelligent FAR-Compliant Pricing Analysis Engine**

## 📋 OVERVIEW

The Government Contract Pricing System is a comprehensive, FAR 15.404-compliant cost/price analysis
engine that automatically generates complete government contract proposals with all required
schedules and documentation.

### **What It Does**

When a user uploads a government solicitation (RFP, RFQ, RFB), the system:

1. **Detects** if it's a government solicitation (vs. commercial)
2. **Analyzes** evaluation criteria (LPTA, Best Value, Price-Only)
3. **Identifies** contract type (FFP, CPFF, T&M, etc.)
4. **Calculates** complete cost breakdown (direct, indirect, profit)
5. **Generates** all required FAR-compliant schedules
6. **Verifies** accuracy and compliance
7. **Provides** strategic recommendations

## 🎯 KEY FEATURES

### ✅ **Automatic Detection**

- Identifies government solicitations using multiple indicators
- Distinguishes federal/state/local procurements
- Recognizes FAR-specific terminology

### ✅ **Evaluation Criteria Analysis**

- **LPTA (Lowest Price Technically Acceptable)**
  - Recommends competitive pricing strategy
  - Warns if price is too high
  - Suggests cost reduction options

- **Best Value Tradeoff**
  - Extracts factor weights (Technical, Past Performance, Price)
  - Allows premium pricing for quality
  - Provides value justification

- **Price-Only**
  - Focuses on cost minimization
  - Recommends most competitive approach

### ✅ **Contract Type Adaptation**

- **Firm Fixed Price (FFP)**
  - Adds risk premium
  - Includes contingency reserves
  - Provides price stability

- **Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF)**
  - Reduces risk premium
  - Emphasizes cost transparency
  - Includes monthly reporting requirements

- **Time & Materials (T&M)**
  - Generates fully-burdened hourly rates
  - Provides labor category schedule
  - Includes not-to-exceed ceiling

### ✅ **Complete Cost Calculation**

**Direct Costs:**

- Labor (Drivers, Dispatchers, Supervisors)
  - Base wages based on BLS data
  - Fringe benefits (30%): Health, FICA, Workers Comp, Retirement
- Materials (Fuel, Supplies, Maintenance)
  - Current market pricing
  - DOE fuel index
- Subcontractors (Maintenance, Backup Equipment)

**Indirect Costs:**

- Overhead calculation (37.8% default)
  - Administrative expenses
  - Facilities & occupancy
  - Operations support
  - Sales & marketing
- Allocation base: Direct Labor

**Profit:**

- FAR 15.404-4 Weighted Guidelines Method
- Factors: Contractor effort, cost risk, socioeconomic, capital, efficiency
- Typical range: 8-15%

### ✅ **All Required Schedules Generated**

1. **Schedule 1: Labor Detail**
   - Each labor category with hours and rates
   - Fringe benefit breakdown
   - Total direct labor costs

2. **Schedule 2: Bill of Materials (BOM)**
   - Fuel (with DOE pricing)
   - Supplies (maintenance, safety, office)
   - Subcontractor services

3. **Schedule 3: Indirect Rate Computation**
   - Annual overhead pool breakdown
   - Allocation base calculation
   - Rate validation vs. industry benchmarks

4. **Schedule 4: Basis of Estimate (BOE)**
   - Detailed rationale for all costs
   - Data sources (BLS, DOE, market research)
   - Assumptions and methodology

5. **Pricing Narrative**
   - Fair and reasonable price determination
   - Market comparison
   - Value proposition
   - Risk mitigation
   - Socioeconomic benefits

### ✅ **Verification System**

- Mathematical accuracy check
- Compliance validation
- Reasonableness assessment
- Warning flags for risks
- Ready-for-submission confirmation

## 🚀 HOW IT WORKS

### **1. User Uploads Document**

User uploads RFP/RFQ/RFB PDF on the FreightFlow RFX page.

### **2. System Analyzes Document**

```typescript
// Extract text from PDF
const documentContent = await extractPDFText(fileData);

// Detect if government solicitation
const isGovSolicitation = isGovernmentSolicitation(documentContent, fileName);
```

**Detection Criteria (requires 2+ indicators):**

- Government entity keywords (federal, state, county, city)
- Agency names (GSA, DOT, FMCSA, DOD, etc.)
- FAR terminology (solicitation number, NAICS, DUNS, SAM.gov)
- Contract types (firm fixed price, cost-plus, T&M)
- Evaluation methods (LPTA, best value)
- Procurement language (BOE, indirect rates, FAR 15.404)

### **3. Generate Pricing Analysis**

If government solicitation detected:

```typescript
const governmentPricingAnalysis = await analyzeGovernmentPricing({
  requirements: extractedRequirements,
  documentContent,
  userProfile,
  companyFinancials,
});
```

### **4. Analysis Process**

**Step 1: Detect Evaluation Criteria**

```typescript
evaluationCriteria = detectEvaluationCriteria(documentContent);
// Returns: { method: 'BEST_VALUE', factors: { technical: 40, pastPerformance: 30, price: 30 } }
```

**Step 2: Detect Contract Type**

```typescript
contractType = detectContractType(documentContent);
// Returns: { type: 'FFP', performancePeriod: '12 months' }
```

**Step 3: Calculate Direct Costs**

```typescript
directCosts = calculateDirectCosts(requirements, userProfile, financials);
// Calculates labor, materials, subcontractors based on volume requirements
```

**Step 4: Calculate Indirect Costs**

```typescript
indirectCosts = calculateIndirectCosts(directLaborTotal, financials);
// Applies overhead rate to direct labor
```

**Step 5: Determine Profit**

```typescript
profitAnalysis = calculateProfit(totalCost, contractType, evaluationCriteria, financials);
// Uses FAR 15.404-4 Weighted Guidelines Method
```

**Step 6: Develop Pricing Strategy**

```typescript
pricingStrategy = developPricingStrategy(totalPrice, evaluationCriteria, contractType, requirements, userProfile);
// Provides recommendations based on LPTA vs Best Value, competitive risk analysis
```

**Step 7: Generate All Schedules**

```typescript
schedules = generateAllSchedules(directCosts, indirectCosts, profitAnalysis, userProfile, financials, contractType);
// Creates Labor Detail, BOM, Indirect Rates, BOE, Pricing Narrative
```

**Step 8: Verify Proposal**

```typescript
verificationReport = verifyProposal(directCosts, indirectCosts, profitAnalysis, totalPrice, pricingStrategy);
// Checks math, compliance, reasonableness
```

### **5. Display in Bid Response**

The system generates a comprehensive bid response that includes:

**Main Pricing Section (Section 3):**

- Cost/Price Summary table
- Unit pricing
- Pricing strategy assessment
- Verification status
- List of supporting schedules

**Supporting Schedules (Appendix):** All 5 schedules are appended at the end of the formal bid
document with full detail.
