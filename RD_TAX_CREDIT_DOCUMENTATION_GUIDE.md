# R&D Tax Credit Documentation Guide

## What "Documentation" Actually Means for FleetFlow

**Date**: October 8, 2025 **Purpose**: Practical guide to documenting R&D activities for tax credit
claims

---

## üéØ The Big Picture

When the IRS says you need "contemporaneous documentation," they mean **proof created DURING the R&D
work** (not after the fact) that shows:

1. **WHAT** you were trying to build/solve
2. **WHY** it was technically uncertain
3. **HOW** you experimented to solve it
4. **WHO** worked on it and for how long
5. **HOW MUCH** it cost

**Good News**: You're already creating most of this documentation naturally as you code! You just
need to organize it.

---

## üìã The 5 Types of Documentation You Need

### **1. Project Documentation** (What & Why)

#### **What This Means:**

Document each major feature/component you're building and explain why it's technically challenging.

#### **What You Already Have:**

- ‚úÖ GitHub repository with code
- ‚úÖ README files
- ‚úÖ Code comments
- ‚úÖ Service files with descriptions

#### **What You Need to Add:**

**Create a simple R&D Project Log** (spreadsheet or document):

| Project Name              | Start Date | End Date   | Technical Challenge                                                   | Business Component  |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Desiree AI Agent          | 2025-01-15 | 2025-02-28 | How to train AI to identify high-quality leads from unstructured data | Lead Generation AI  |
| Multi-Tenant Architecture | 2025-02-01 | 2025-03-15 | How to isolate tenant data securely while maintaining performance     | SaaS Platform Core  |
| NEMT Healthcare Platform  | 2025-03-01 | 2025-04-30 | How to build HIPAA-compliant system with Medicaid integration         | Healthcare Division |
| 18 AI Agents Integration  | 2025-04-01 | 2025-06-30 | How to make 18 AI agents work together without conflicts              | AI Orchestration    |
| Pallet Scanning AI        | 2025-05-01 | 2025-07-15 | How to detect freight damage using computer vision                    | Premium Service     |

**Example Entry:**

```markdown
## Project: Desiree AI Agent (Lead Generation)

**Start Date**: January 15, 2025 **End Date**: February 28, 2025

**Technical Challenge (Uncertainty):** How do we train an AI agent to automatically identify
high-quality freight broker leads from unstructured data sources (LinkedIn, company websites,
industry databases) with

> 80% accuracy?

**Why This Was Uncertain:**

- No existing AI model trained on freight broker lead qualification
- Unclear which data points predict lead quality
- Unknown how to integrate multiple data sources in real-time
- Uncertain how to avoid false positives/negatives

**Business Component:** AI-powered lead generation system that replaces manual prospecting

**Qualified Expenses:**

- Developer wages: $15,000
- API costs (OpenAI, data sources): $2,000
- Cloud hosting: $500
```

#### **How to Create This:**

- Spend **2-3 hours** creating this log for all major projects
- Update it **monthly** as you start new projects
- Keep it simple (spreadsheet or Google Doc is fine)

---

### **2. Technical Uncertainty Documentation** (Why It Was Hard)

#### **What This Means:**

Prove that you didn't know how to solve the problem at the start.

#### **What You Already Have:**

- ‚úÖ Code iterations in GitHub (shows you tried different approaches)
- ‚úÖ Bug reports/issues
- ‚úÖ Stack Overflow searches (browser history)

#### **What You Need to Add:**

**Create a "Technical Uncertainties" document** for each major project:

**Example:**

```markdown
## Technical Uncertainties: Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture

### Uncertainty #1: Data Isolation

**Question**: How do we ensure Tenant A can never access Tenant B's data?

**Why Uncertain**:

- Multiple approaches exist (separate databases, row-level security, schema isolation)
- Unknown which approach scales best
- Unclear performance impact of each approach
- Security implications not fully understood

**Alternatives Evaluated**:

1. Separate database per tenant (too expensive, doesn't scale)
2. Shared database with tenant_id column (risk of query bugs exposing data)
3. PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (chosen - but required experimentation)

**Resolution**: Implemented PostgreSQL RLS after testing showed 15% performance overhead but 100%
data isolation guarantee.

### Uncertainty #2: Authentication Across Tenants

**Question**: How do users authenticate when multiple tenants share the same domain?

**Why Uncertain**:

- JWT tokens need tenant context
- Session management across subdomains unclear
- Unknown how to prevent token reuse across tenants

**Alternatives Evaluated**:

1. Separate subdomain per tenant (DNS complexity)
2. Tenant ID in JWT claims (chosen)
3. Separate auth servers per tenant (too expensive)

**Resolution**: Embedded tenant_id in JWT claims with middleware validation on every request.
```

#### **How to Create This:**

- For each major project, write **3-5 technical uncertainties**
- Describe **2-3 alternatives** you considered for each
- Explain **why you chose** the final approach
- Takes **1-2 hours per project**

---

### **3. Experimentation Documentation** (How You Solved It)

#### **What This Means:**

Show that you tested different approaches (not just built the first thing that came to mind).

#### **What You Already Have:**

- ‚úÖ GitHub commits showing iterations
- ‚úÖ Different branches for experiments
- ‚úÖ Code comments like "// tried X but Y was faster"

#### **What You Need to Add:**

**Create an "Experiments Log"**:

**Example:**

```markdown
## Experiment Log: AI Agent Response Time Optimization

### Experiment #1: Parallel API Calls

**Date**: March 15, 2025 **Hypothesis**: Calling multiple AI agents in parallel will reduce response
time **Method**: Refactored sequential API calls to Promise.all() **Result**: Response time reduced
from 8.5s to 3.2s (62% improvement) **Conclusion**: SUCCESS - implemented in production

### Experiment #2: Caching AI Responses

**Date**: March 22, 2025 **Hypothesis**: Caching similar queries will reduce API costs and improve
speed **Method**: Implemented Redis cache with 24-hour TTL **Result**: Cache hit rate 45%, reduced
API costs by $400/month **Conclusion**: SUCCESS - implemented in production

### Experiment #3: Fine-Tuned Model vs. GPT-4

**Date**: April 5, 2025 **Hypothesis**: Fine-tuned model will be faster and cheaper than GPT-4
**Method**: Trained custom model on 10,000 freight broker queries **Result**: Accuracy dropped from
94% to 78%, not acceptable **Conclusion**: FAILED - continued using GPT-4

### Experiment #4: Database Query Optimization

**Date**: April 18, 2025 **Hypothesis**: Adding indexes will speed up tenant data queries
**Method**: Added composite indexes on (tenant_id, created_at) **Result**: Query time reduced from
450ms to 85ms (81% improvement) **Conclusion**: SUCCESS - implemented across all tables
```

#### **How to Create This:**

- **As you code**, keep a running log of experiments
- Note **what worked** and **what didn't**
- Include **performance metrics** (speed, cost, accuracy)
- Takes **5-10 minutes per experiment** (do it in real-time)

---

### **4. Time Tracking** (Who & How Long)

#### **What This Means:**

Track how much time you (and any employees) spend on qualified R&D activities.

#### **What You Already Have:**

- ‚úÖ GitHub commit timestamps
- ‚úÖ Your work schedule (you know roughly when you coded)

#### **What You Need to Add:**

**Option A: Simple Time Log** (Spreadsheet)

| Date       | Person        | Project      | Hours | Activity Type         | Qualified? |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| 2025-01-15 | Dieasha Davis | Desiree AI   | 8     | AI model training     | YES        |
| 2025-01-16 | Dieasha Davis | Desiree AI   | 6     | Testing & iteration   | YES        |
| 2025-01-17 | Dieasha Davis | UI Design    | 4     | Frontend styling      | NO         |
| 2025-01-18 | Dieasha Davis | Multi-Tenant | 8     | Database architecture | YES        |

**Option B: Use Time Tracking Software**

- Toggl Track (free)
- Clockify (free)
- Harvest (paid)

**What Qualifies as R&D Time:**

- ‚úÖ Writing code for new features
- ‚úÖ Testing and debugging technical issues
- ‚úÖ Researching technical solutions
- ‚úÖ Experimenting with different approaches

- ‚ùå Basic UI styling (unless solving technical challenge)
- ‚ùå Writing documentation for users

#### **How to Create This:**

**Retroactive (for 2025 so far):**

1. Look at your GitHub commits (timestamps show when you worked)
2. Estimate hours per day based on commit activity
3. Assume **80-90% of development time is qualified**
4. Create a spreadsheet with estimates

**Example:**

```
January 2025: 160 hours total development
- 140 hours qualified R&D (AI agents, platform architecture)
- 20 hours non-qualified (UI tweaks, admin)

February 2025: 180 hours total development
- 160 hours qualified R&D (multi-tenant, NEMT platform)
- 20 hours non-qualified (marketing site, documentation)
```

**Going Forward:**

- Track time **daily** (takes 2 minutes per day)
- Use a simple spreadsheet or time tracking app
- Note project and whether it's qualified R&D

---

### **5. Expense Tracking** (How Much)

#### **What This Means:**

Track all costs related to R&D activities.

#### **What You Already Have:**

- ‚úÖ Bank statements
- ‚úÖ Credit card statements
- ‚úÖ Invoices from vendors

#### **What You Need to Add:**

**Create an "R&D Expenses" spreadsheet**:

| Date       | Vendor        | Description           | Amount | Category  | Qualified? |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------------- | ------ | --------- | ---------- |

## üí° Pro Tips

### **1. GitHub is Your Best Friend**

Your commit history is **contemporaneous documentation** that the IRS loves:

- Shows what you worked on and when
- Proves you iterated and experimented
- Timestamps are automatic and trustworthy

### **2. Keep It Simple**

You don't need fancy software. A Google Sheet is fine:

- Project log: 1 sheet
- Time tracking: 1 sheet
- Expenses: 1 sheet

### **3. Document as You Go**

Spending 5 minutes per day documenting is WAY easier than trying to recreate 12 months of work
later.

### **4. When in Doubt, Document It**

If you're unsure whether something qualifies, document it anyway. Let your CPA decide.

### **5. Save Everything**

- GitHub commits
- Slack/email discussions about technical problems
- Architecture diagrams
- Performance benchmarks
- Bug reports
- API documentation

---

## üö® What NOT to Do

### **‚ùå Don't Recreate Documentation After the Fact**

The IRS wants "contemporaneous" documentation (created during R&D). Don't write fake dates.

### **‚ùå Don't Claim Everything as R&D**

Marketing, sales, admin work don't qualify. Be honest about what's R&D vs. other activities.

### **‚ùå Don't Skip Time Tracking**

"I worked a lot" isn't enough. You need hours (even estimates based on GitHub commits).

### **‚ùå Don't Lose Receipts**

Keep all invoices for tech expenses. Digital copies are fine.

### **‚ùå Don't DIY the Tax Forms**

Hire a specialist. Form 6765 is complex, and mistakes can trigger audits.

## üìû Questions?

**"Do I really need to do all this?"** Yes, if you want to claim $50K+ in credits. The IRS requires
documentation.

**"What if I didn't track time in 2025?"** Use GitHub commits to estimate hours retroactively. Not
perfect, but acceptable.

**"Can I just have my CPA do everything?"** No. You need to provide the raw data (projects, time,
expenses). They can't create it for you.

**"What if I get audited?"** With proper documentation, you'll be fine. That's why contemporaneous
documentation matters.

**"Is this really worth it?"** YES. 15 hours of work for $50K-$60K = $3,000-$4,000 per hour. Best
ROI you'll ever get.

---

## üéØ Bottom Line

**"Documentation" = 4 Simple Things:**

1. **Project Log**: What you built and why it was hard (3 hours one-time)
2. **Time Tracking**: How many hours on R&D (2 min/day going forward)
3. **Expense Tracking**: What you spent on R&D (30 min/month)
4. **Technical Uncertainties**: How you solved hard problems (1 hour/quarter)

**Total Time Investment**: ~15 hours in Year 1, ~10 hours/year ongoing

**Total Value**: $50K-$60K (2025), $200K-$300K/year (post-Series A), $1M+ (3 years)

**Start today. Your future self (and your bank account) will thank you.**
