# TWILIO TOLL-FREE VERIFICATION - QUICK START

## üéØ WHAT I FIXED FOR YOU

I've implemented a complete SMS consent system to pass Twilio's toll-free verification. Here's
what's now in place:

### ‚úÖ NEW FILES CREATED

1. **`/app/sms-consent/page.tsx`** - Public consent page showing how users opt-in
2. **`/app/services/SMSConsentService.ts`** - Manages SMS consent tracking
3. **`/app/api/twilio/sms-webhook/route.ts`** - Handles STOP/HELP/START keywords

### ‚úÖ FILES UPDATED

1. **`/app/api/auth/register-complete/route.ts`** - Added SMS consent to registration
2. **`/app/services/CommunicationService.ts`** - Now checks consent before sending SMS

## üöÄ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (3 STEPS)

### STEP 1: Deploy to Production

```bash
cd /Users/deedavis/FLEETFLOW
git add .
git commit -m "Add SMS consent system for Twilio compliance"
git push origin main

# Deploy to Digital Ocean (use your existing process)
```

### STEP 2: Verify Consent Page is Live

After deployment, visit:

```
https://fleetflowapp.com/sms-consent
```

Make sure it loads properly. This is the URL you'll give to Twilio.

### STEP 3: Resubmit to Twilio

1. Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
2. Navigate to **Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Toll-Free Verification**
3. Edit your rejected submission (or delete and create new)
4. Fill in the form using the guide in `TWILIO_TOLL_FREE_VERIFICATION_FIX.md`

**MOST IMPORTANT FIELDS:**

- **Opt-In Consent URL:** `https://fleetflowapp.com/sms-consent`
- **How Users Opt-In:** Copy from the detailed guide
- **Sample Messages:** Provide 3 real examples
- **Business Name:** FleetFlow (NOT DEPOINTE)

## üîß WEBHOOK CONFIGURATION (After Approval)

Once Twilio approves your toll-free number, configure the webhook:

1. Go to your toll-free number in Twilio Console
2. **Messaging ‚Üí When a message comes in:**
   ```
   https://fleetflowapp.com/api/twilio/sms-webhook
   ```
   Method: HTTP POST

This will automatically handle STOP/HELP/START keywords.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Deploy First:** Make sure `/sms-consent` page is live BEFORE submitting to Twilio
2. **Use FleetFlow Brand:** All Twilio submissions should say "FleetFlow" not "DEPOINTE"
3. **Be Specific:** Don't just say "notifications" - list exact message types
4. **Real Examples:** Sample messages must be realistic, not templates
