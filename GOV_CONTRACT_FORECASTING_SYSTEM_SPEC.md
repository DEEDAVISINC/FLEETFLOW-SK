   ```javascript
   - Extract PDF/Word documents from opportunity notices
   - OCR for scanned documents
   - Parse key sections: SOW, requirements, evaluation criteria
   - Extract contracting officer contact information
   ```

   ```javascript
   ANALYSIS_CRITERIA = {
     company_capabilities_match: 'Transportation, TMS, WOSB status',
     technical_requirements_alignment: 'Software, tracking, compliance',
     past_performance_relevance: 'Similar contracts, size, scope',
     geographic_advantage: 'Michigan-based, nationwide service',
     certification_advantages: 'WOSB set-aside, small business',
     competition_level: 'Number of potential bidders',
     contract_value_appropriateness: 'Revenue capacity, bonding',
   };
   ```

3. **Win Probability Calculation**

   ```javascript
   WIN_PROBABILITY_FACTORS = {
     wosb_set_aside: +25%, // WOSB contracts have 50-80% less competition
     past_performance_match: +20%,
     technical_capability_fit: +15%,
     geographic_preference: +10%,
     small_business_size_match: +10%,
     required_certifications_held: +10%,
     relationship_with_agency: +5%,

   }
   ```

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Incumbent contractor presence
   - Complex technical requirements
   - Unrealistic timelines
   - Required certifications not held
   - Geographic limitations
   - Bonding requirements

5. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Bid/No-Bid recommendation with reasoning
