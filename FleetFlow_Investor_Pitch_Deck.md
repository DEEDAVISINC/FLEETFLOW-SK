- **Board Seat**: 1 board observer seat
- **Liquidation Preference**: 1x non-participating
- **Milestone Rights**: Anti-dilution protection

### Investment Returns & ROI

**Conservative Exit Scenario ($75B acquisition in 18 months):**

- **Investment**: $25M at $75M pre-money valuation (25% ownership)
- **Exit Value**: $75B × 25% = **$18.75B return**
- **ROI**: **750x return** in 18 months
- **IRR**: **>1,000% annualized**

**Realistic Exit Scenario ($100B acquisition in 18 months):**

- **Investment**: $25M at $75M pre-money valuation (25% ownership)
- **Exit Value**: $100B × 25% = **$25B return**
- **ROI**: **1,000x return** in 18 months
- **IRR**: **>1,500% annualized**

**Aggressive Exit Scenario ($125B acquisition in 18 months):**

- **Investment**: $25M at $75M pre-money valuation (25% ownership)
- **Exit Value**: $125B × 25% = **$31.25B return**
- **ROI**: **1,250x return** in 18 months
- **IRR**: **>2,000% annualized**

**Downside Protection:**

Even at conservative $50B acquisition (unlikely given strategic value):

- **Exit Value**: $50B × 25% = **$12.5B return**
- **ROI**: **500x return** in 18 months
- **Still exceptional returns** with massive downside protection

**Why These Returns Are Achievable:**

- ✅ **Proven Revenue**: $31M ARR already achieved, not a projection
- ✅ **Strategic Necessity**: Acquirers must have transportation BI platform
- ✅ **Multiple Bidders**: Microsoft, Salesforce, Google all need FleetFlow
- ✅ **Healthcare Premium**: NEMT division adds $10-20B valuation
- ✅ **Competitive Urgency**: Acquirers can't let competitors get FleetFlow

**This is a once-in-a-decade investment opportunity**
