## üìã Feature #1: Enhanced Console Logging

### How to Use:

1. Open browser Developer Console (F12)
2. Go to FreightFlow RFx page
3. Analyze any RFP/RFQ with AI
4. Watch the console for detailed save logs:
   ```
   üíæ AUTO-SAVING bid draft: {documentName, solicitationId, method: "CREATE", timestamp}
   ‚úÖ Bid auto-saved: {id, documentName, status, createdAt}
   ```
5. If save fails, you'll see:
   ```
   ‚ùå Auto-save failed: {error, details, bidData}
   ```

### Files Modified:

- `app/freightflow-rfx/page.tsx` (lines 1420-1479)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: SQL Migration Required

2. Open `/Users/deedavis/FLEETFLOW/scripts/add-soft-delete-to-rfx-bids.sql`
3. Copy and paste the entire contents
4. Click "Run"

**What the SQL does**:

- Adds `deleted_at` and `deleted_by` columns
- Creates indexes for performance
- Sets up views for active/trash bids
- Adds cleanup function for bids older than 30 days

### Files Modified/Created:

- `app/api/rfx-bids/route.ts` (API endpoints)
- `app/freightflow-rfx/page.tsx` (UI and functions)
