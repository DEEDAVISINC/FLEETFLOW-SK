Subject: Reduce China import costs by 15-20%?

Hi [Contact],

I noticed [Company] imports [Product Category] from China.

With the 95% tariff on [steel/metal/aluminum], importers
are desperate for cost certainty.

We offer China-USA DDP service:
âœ… One invoice (all costs included)
âœ… One touchpoint (I manage everything)
âœ… Reduced total cost (no surprise fees)
âœ… 40HQ preferred - best for heavy products

Can we schedule 15 minutes to see if we can reduce
your total cost by 15-20%?

Best regards,
Marcus Chen
International Freight & Customs Specialist
```

### 3. Qualification (Automated) âœ…

- High-score leads (85+) get prioritized
- Marcus monitors for responses
- Interested leads â†’ "Qualified" status

### 4. Conversion to Inquiry ðŸŽ‰

- Qualified leads â†’ Active DDP Inquiry
- Marcus starts collecting "Big 5" data:
  1. Exact China pickup address
  2. Exact USA drop-off address
  3. Product HTS + description + picture
  4. Shipment timing
  5. Container quantity/type

### 5. Quote & Payment ðŸ’°

- Once Big 5 complete â†’ Auto-quote generated
- First 3 months: Prepayment required
- After 3 months: NET-30/60 payment terms
- 40HQ containers preferred (best rates)

**Extension won't install**

- Icons missing? See `chrome-extension/ICONS-README.txt`

## Best Practices

### 1. Target High-Value Prospects

Focus on companies importing:

- **Steel** (95% tariff)
- **Metal** (95% tariff)

These companies are **desperate for savings**.

### 2. Import in Batches

- Start with 10-20 leads to test
- Review Marcus Chen's outreach
- Scale up to 50-100 leads per day

### 3. Monitor Lead Quality

Watch the stats:

- **Lead Score**: 85+ = hot prospects
- **Conversion Rate**: % of leads â†’ inquiries
- **Response Rate**: Track in Marcus's activities

### 4. Regular ImportYeti Scraping

- Scrape daily/weekly
- New shipments = hot leads
- Companies with recent shipments are active buyers
