#### **CRITICAL: Opt-In & Consent Information**

This is where your previous submission failed. Use these exact details:

**Opt-In Consent URL:**

```
https://fleetflowapp.com/sms-consent
```

**How Users Opt-In:**

```
Users consent to receive SMS messages in two ways:

1. DURING REGISTRATION: When creating a FleetFlow account, users must check a consent checkbox that reads:

"I agree to receive SMS text messages from FleetFlow regarding load alerts, shipment updates, dispatch notifications, payment reminders, and service updates. Message frequency varies based on your activity and preferences. Message and data rates may apply. You can opt-out at any time by replying STOP to any message. Reply HELP for assistance."

2. ACCOUNT SETTINGS: Existing users can opt-in by enabling SMS notifications in their account settings after reviewing and accepting the same consent agreement.

All consent is recorded with timestamp, IP address, and user agent for compliance tracking.
```

**Opt-Out Method:**

```
Users can opt-out at any time by:
1. Replying STOP, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, END, or QUIT to any SMS message
2. Disabling SMS notifications in their FleetFlow account settings

Opt-out requests are processed immediately, and users receive a confirmation message.
```

**Sample Message Content:**

```
Example 1 (Load Alert):
"New load available: Chicago, IL ‚Üí Dallas, TX | Dry Van | 45,000 lbs | $2,850 | Pickup: 10/15 | View: fleetflowapp.com/loads/12345"

Example 2 (Shipment Update):
"Shipment #FF-2025-0042 status update: Delivered successfully at 2:30 PM. POD uploaded. Invoice ready for processing."

Example 3 (Payment Reminder):
"Payment reminder: Invoice #INV-2025-0125 ($3,200) is due in 3 days. Pay now: fleetflowapp.com/invoices"
```

**Message Frequency:**

```
Message frequency varies based on user activity and business operations. Active users receive approximately 5-20 messages per week. Users can adjust notification preferences in their account settings.
```

**HELP Keyword Response:**

```
FleetFlow SMS Help: You are receiving logistics notifications. Reply STOP to unsubscribe. Msg&data rates may apply. Support: support@fleetflowapp.com or 1-800-FLEETFLOW
```

#### **Compliance & Legal**

**Terms of Service URL:**

```
https://fleetflowapp.com/terms-of-service
```

**Privacy Policy URL:**

```
https://fleetflowapp.com/privacy-policy
```

**SMS-Specific Terms (if asked):**

```

## üÜò IF TWILIO ASKS FOR MORE INFO

Common follow-up requests and how to respond:

### "Can you provide a screenshot of your opt-in form?"

Take a screenshot of your registration page showing the SMS consent checkbox. The checkbox should
clearly display the opt-in language.

### "How do you verify phone numbers?"

Response:

```
Phone numbers are collected during user registration. We validate format and store the number securely. Users must actively check the SMS consent checkbox to opt-in - it is not pre-checked. Consent is recorded with timestamp, IP address, and user agent for audit purposes.
```

### "What is your process for handling STOP requests?"

Response:

```
STOP requests are handled via automated webhook at /api/twilio/sms-webhook. When a user texts STOP (or UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, END, QUIT), we:
1. Immediately revoke their SMS consent in our database
2. Log the opt-out with timestamp and method
3. Send confirmation: "You have been unsubscribed from FleetFlow SMS messages. Reply START to re-subscribe."
4. Block all future SMS sends to that user/phone number
```

### "Can you provide your full SMS terms?"

Provide the URL:

```
https://fleetflowapp.com/sms-consent
```

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Use FleetFlow Brand:** All submissions should reference "FleetFlow" (the SaaS platform), NOT
   "DEPOINTE AI Company" (which is just one tenant/customer of FleetFlow)

2. **Consent Page Must Be Live:** Make sure `/sms-consent` is deployed and accessible at
   `https://fleetflowapp.com/sms-consent` BEFORE submitting

3. **Don't Skip Required Fields:** Every field in the Twilio form matters. Empty or vague fields
   will cause rejection.

4. **Be Specific:** Instead of "notifications," say "load alerts, shipment updates, dispatch
   notifications, payment reminders"

5. **Sample Messages Must Be Realistic:** Show actual examples of SMS messages you'll send, not
   generic templates
