## üéØ WHY THESE FEATURES WERE MISSED

**Root Causes**:
1. Features built incrementally over 3-6 months
2. Documentation created in separate .md files (COMPLETE-LEAD-GENERATION-SYSTEM.md, DUAL_LEAD_GENERATION_COMPLETE.md, SALES_COPILOT_PHONE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, etc.)
3. Business plan updates focused on recent additions (LRAF, Financial Services) vs. comprehensive audit
4. No master feature inventory maintained since platform inception

**Lesson Learned**:
- Implement quarterly comprehensive feature audits
- Maintain master feature list with dates, files, and valuations
- Systematic business plan reviews before investor/acquisition discussions
