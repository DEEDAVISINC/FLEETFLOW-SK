## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

### **1. Regular Credit Method is HUGE**

Going from ASC (14%) to Regular (20%) gives you **43% more credit** with the SAME expenses!

**Why?** Because 2025 is your first year, so base = $0, and Regular gives you 20% of everything.

**This alone adds $77,232 to your credit!**

### **2. Hour Tracking Matters**

If you're actually working 50-60 hrs/week (which you probably are building 27 AI agents), that's 333
more hours = **$83,250 more QRE** = **$11,655 more credits**

### **3. Small Expenses Add Up**

Every $10,000 in expenses = $1,790 in credits

If you find $50,000 in missed expenses = **$8,950 in credits**

### **4. The Refundable Portion Grows**

25% of your credit is CASH REFUND

- At $202K credits: $39,589 cash
- At $342K credits: $71,605 cash
- **Difference: $32,016 more cash in your pocket!**

---

## üéâ BOTTOM LINE

### **You Have Three Choices:**

**1. Do Nothing** (Conservative)

- Keep current estimate: $202,468
- Cash refund: $39,589
- **Easy but leaves money on table**

**2. Better Documentation** (Realistic)

- Steps 1-2: $230,409 (+$27,941)
- Cash refund: $45,052 (+$5,463)
- **Low effort, good return**

**3. Full Maximization** (Maximum)

- Steps 1-4: $342,272 (+$139,804)
- Cash refund: $71,605 (+$32,016)
- **More work, maximum return**

- Better hour tracking ‚úÖ
- Comprehensive expenses ‚úÖ
- Regular Credit method ‚úÖ
- Keep $250/hr rate ‚úÖ

**Result**: ~$307,641 (+$105,173)
