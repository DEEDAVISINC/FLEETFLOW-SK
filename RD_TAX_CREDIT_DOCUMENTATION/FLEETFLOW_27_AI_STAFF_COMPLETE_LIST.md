- Central coordinator managing 27 concurrent operations
- Conflict detection across 27 different roles
- Shared context management for 27 agents
- Real-time task routing to appropriate agent

### **Development Effort**

**Total Development Time**: 850+ hours

- Individual agent development: 27 agents √ó 15 hours avg = 405 hours
- Orchestration system: 200 hours
- Testing and optimization: 150 hours
- Integration and deployment: 95 hours

**Cost**: $212,500+ in qualified wages alone

### **Technical Achievements**

‚úÖ **94% Automation Rate**: 27 agents working together achieve 94% task automation ‚úÖ **Zero
Conflicts**: Conflict detection prevents duplicate actions ‚úÖ **3.2s Response Time**: All 27 agents
coordinate in under 4 seconds ‚úÖ **Scalable Architecture**: Can expand to 50+ agents without
redesign ‚úÖ **Multi-Industry**: Agents serve freight, healthcare, government contracting
