## Project 1: AI Agent Development (18 Specialized Agents)

### Technical Uncertainty #1: Multi-Agent Coordination

**Question**: How do we prevent 18 AI agents from conflicting with each other (e.g., two agents
contacting the same lead)?

**Why Uncertain**:

- No existing framework for coordinating 18+ AI agents
- Unknown how to detect potential conflicts before they occur
- Unclear how to prioritize agent actions when multiple agents want to act
- Uncertain about performance impact of coordination overhead

**Alternatives Evaluated**:

| Approach             | Description                        | Result                                      | Decision      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Sequential Execution | Run agents one at a time           | Too slow (8.5s response time)               | ❌ Rejected   |
| Independent Agents   | No coordination                    | Conflicts occurred (same lead contacted 3x) | ❌ Rejected   |
| Central Orchestrator | Task queue with conflict detection | Fast (3.2s) + no conflicts                  | ✅ **CHOSEN** |
| Event-Driven         | Agents subscribe to events         | Too complex for initial MVP                 | ❌ Rejected   |
