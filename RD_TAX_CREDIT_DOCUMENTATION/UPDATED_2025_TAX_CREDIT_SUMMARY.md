## 🧮 Tax Credit Calculations

### **Federal R&D Credit (Alternative Simplified Credit Method)**

**Formula**: 14% × (Current Year QREs - 50% of Average Prior 3 Years QREs)

**FleetFlow Calculation** (2025 is first year):

- Current Year QREs: $1,131,105
- Prior 3 Years Average: $0 (new company established 2025)
- ASC Base: 50% × $0 = $0
- Qualified Amount: $1,131,105 - $0 = $1,131,105
- **Federal Credit**: 14% × $1,131,105 = **$158,355**

### **Michigan R&D Credit**

**Formula**: 3.9% × Federal QREs

**FleetFlow Calculation**:

- Federal QREs: $1,131,105
- **Michigan Credit**: 3.9% × $1,131,105 = **$44,113**

### **Total 2025 R&D Tax Credits**

| Credit Type         | Calculation       | Amount       |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| Federal R&D Credit  | 14% × $1,131,105  | $158,355     |
| Michigan R&D Credit | 3.9% × $1,131,105 | $44,113      |
