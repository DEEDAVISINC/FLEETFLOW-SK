## üí° Pro Tips

### **Tip 1: Use GitHub Commits for Time Tracking**

Your commits show exactly when you worked:

- 10 commits/day = ~8 hours
- 5 commits/day = ~4 hours
- 0 commits = non-dev day

### **Tip 2: Save Receipts Immediately**

When you get a tech invoice:

1. Download PDF
2. Save to `Receipts_2025/[Month]/`
3. Takes 30 seconds now vs. hours later

### **Tip 3: Track New Projects as You Start Them**

When you start a new feature:

1. Open `2025_Project_Log.md`
2. Add 3 sentences:
   - What you're building
   - Why it's technically challenging
   - What you're trying to solve
3. Takes 5 minutes, saves hours later

### **Tip 4: Document "Aha!" Moments**

When you solve a hard problem:

1. Open `Technical_Uncertainties_Summary.md`
2. Write down:
   - What you tried
   - What worked
   - What didn't work
3. This is GOLD for R&D credits

### **Tip 5: Set Monthly Reminders**

- Calendar reminder: "Update R&D docs" on 5th of each month
- Takes 30-45 minutes
- Worth $2,000-$3,000 per hour of your time

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: What if I forget to update for a month?** A: Use GitHub commits to backfill. Not ideal, but
workable.

**Q: Do I need to track EVERY expense?** A: Just tech expenses (cloud, APIs, tools). Skip office
supplies, marketing, etc.

**Q: What if I'm not sure if something qualifies?** A: Document it anyway. Let your CPA decide.
Better to have too much info than too little.

**Q: Can I just do this all in January?** A: You can, but it's WAY harder. 30 min/month now vs. 10+
hours in January.

**Q: What if my expenses change?** A: That's fine! Just update the monthly totals. Estimates are
okay for future months.
