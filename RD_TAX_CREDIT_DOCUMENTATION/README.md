## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Do I really need all this documentation?** A: Yes. The IRS requires "contemporaneous
documentation" (created during R&D) to claim credits.

**Q: What if I get audited?** A: With this documentation, you're well-prepared. The IRS wants to see
exactly what we've documented here.

**Q: Can I claim credits for prior years?** A: No. FleetFlow was established in 2025, so 2025 is the
first year. But you can claim credits every year going forward!

**Q: How much will the CPA cost?** A: R&D tax credit specialists typically charge $5,000-$15,000 for
the first year. ROI is 2-6x (you get $30K+ in credits).

**Q: What if I didn't track time perfectly?** A: GitHub commits provide contemporaneous evidence. We
can estimate hours based on commit activity.

**Q: Do I need to track time going forward?** A: Yes! Starting now, track time daily (2
minutes/day). It's much easier than recreating it later.
