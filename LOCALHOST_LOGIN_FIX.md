# Fix Localhost Login Redirect Loop

## üî¥ Problem

You're successfully logging in (server shows success) but browser keeps redirecting back to signin
page.

## ‚úÖ Solution - Try These in Order

### Option 1: Clear Browser Storage (Most Common Fix)

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **Clear storage** on the left
4. Check all boxes:
   - ‚úÖ Cookies
   - ‚úÖ Local storage
   - ‚úÖ Session storage
   - ‚úÖ Cache storage
5. Click **Clear site data**
6. **Close the browser completely**
7. Reopen and try: http://localhost:3001/auth/signin

### Option 2: Use Incognito Window

1. Open **Chrome Incognito** (Cmd+Shift+N)
2. Go to: http://localhost:3001/auth/signin
3. Login with: info@deedavis.biz
4. Should work fresh without cached issues

### Option 3: Clear Specific Cookies

1. DevTools > Application > Cookies
2. Delete these cookies for localhost:3001:
   - `next-auth.session-token`
   - `next-auth.callback-url`
   - `next-auth.csrf-token`
3. Refresh and try again

### Option 4: Direct Dashboard Access

After logging in, instead of waiting for redirect, manually go to:

- http://localhost:3001/fleetflowdash
- http://localhost:3001/depointe-dashboard
- http://localhost:3001/freightflow-rfx

The logs show you have access! The browser just isn't following the redirect.

## üîç What's Happening (From Server Logs)

```
‚úÖ DEPOINTE LOGIN SUCCESS: info@deedavis.biz  <- YOU ARE LOGGED IN!
‚úÖ ADMIN ACCESS to /fleetflowdash             <- YOU HAVE ACCESS!
GET /fleetflowdash 200                        <- PAGE LOADS SUCCESSFULLY!
```

But then browser keeps requesting signin page repeatedly. This is a **client-side** redirect loop,
not a server issue.

## üéØ Quick Test

Try this URL directly after "logging in":

```
http://localhost:3001/fleetflowdash
```

If that loads, your login is working - it's just the redirect that's broken.

## üí° Why This Happens

- Cached redirect from earlier issues
- NextAuth session cookies not being set properly
- Browser security blocking third-party cookies
- LocalStorage conflicts from previous sessions

## ‚ö° Nuclear Option

If nothing else works:

```bash
# Clear all Next.js data
rm -rf /Users/deedavis/FLEETFLOW/.next
rm -rf /Users/deedavis/FLEETFLOW/node_modules/.cache

# Restart dev server (already running)
```

Then clear browser data and try again.
