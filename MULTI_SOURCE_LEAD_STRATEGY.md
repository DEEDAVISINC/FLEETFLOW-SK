}

try {
  // Fetch from FMCSA
} catch (error) {
  console.error('[2/3] FMCSA error:', error);
  // CONTINUES TO NEXT SOURCE
}

try {
  // Fetch from ThomasNet

localStorage.removeItem('depointe-activity-feed');
```

### 2. Deploy a Campaign:

- Healthcare: Should see `[1/3]`, `[2/3]`, `[3/3]` in console
- Shipper: Should see `[1/2]`, `[2/2]` in console
- Desperate: Should see `[1/3]`, `[2/3]`, `[3/3]` in console

### 3. Check CRM Leads:

- Look for variety in `source` field
- Companies from different sources
- Varied contact names (Healthcare Manager vs Supply Chain Director vs Compliance Manager)

### 4. Verify Totals:

- Requested 30 leads → Should get ~30 from combined sources
- Check console for: `🎯 TOTAL: X leads from Y sources`
