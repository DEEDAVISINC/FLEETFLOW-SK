## Intelligent, Role-Specific Bid Pricing System

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** **Date**: October 11, 2025 **Location**:
`/app/api/ai/rfx-analysis/intelligent-pricing-generator.ts`

---

## 🎯 WHAT IT DOES

The **Smart Pricing Generator** automatically analyzes bid requirements and generates:

1. **Role-specific pricing structures** (broker vs. carrier vs. 3PL)
2. **Detailed line items** with units, rates, and notes
3. **Alternative pricing options** (volume discounts, dedicated service, etc.)
4. **Professional pricing terms** and payment conditions
5. **Intelligent recommendations** based on contract type and volume

---

## 🧠 HOW IT'S SMART

### **1. Requirement Analysis**

The system analyzes bid requirements to detect:

- **Service Type**: Transportation, warehousing, handling, etc.
- **Equipment Type**: Dump truck, flatbed, dry van, reefer, tanker
- **Volume**: Daily/weekly/monthly load counts
- **Distance**: Local (<50mi), Regional (state), Long-haul (national)
- **Contract Duration**: Spot, ongoing contract, annual agreement
- **Special Requirements**: Hazmat, temperature control, oversized loads

**Example Analysis**:

```javascript
Input: "Must provide 50 dump truck loads per day for aggregate hauling within county"

Parsed:
{
  serviceType: 'transportation',
  equipmentType: 'dump_truck',
  volume: 50,
  distance: 'local',
  duration: 'contract'
}
```

---

### **2. Pricing Structure Selection**

The generator intelligently selects the optimal pricing model:

| Scenario                 | Pricing Structure | Rationale                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Local/Regional Transport | **Per Load**      | Short distances, fixed origin/destination |
| Long-haul Transport      | **Per Mile**      | Variable distances, route-based pricing   |
| Warehousing Services     | **Monthly**       | Storage = time-based pricing              |
| Multiple Services (3PL)  | **Hybrid**        | Different pricing for each service type   |
| Hourly Services          | **Hourly**        | Wait time, specialized equipment rental   |

### **3. Role-Specific Line Items**

#### **FREIGHT BROKER PRICING** (DEPOINTE Example)
