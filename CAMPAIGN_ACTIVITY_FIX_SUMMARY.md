# Campaign Activity Execution - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem Identified

You had **live campaigns deployed** but were **not seeing any campaign execution activity** (leads
generated, progress updates, revenue tracking).

## Root Causes Found

### 1. **Wrong localStorage Key**

- ‚ùå Service saved activities to: `'depointe-activities'`
- ‚úÖ Dashboard reads from: `'depointe-activity-feed'`
- **Result:** Activities were generated but invisible

### 2. **Only Processing One Campaign Type**

- ‚ùå Service only processed: `'depointe-desperate-prospects-tasks'`
- ‚ùå Ignored: Healthcare & Shipper campaigns
- **Result:** Healthcare and Shipper campaigns never executed

### 3. **Task Format Mismatch**

- ‚ùå Campaign tasks missing required fields for execution:
  - `type`, `targetQuantity`, `progress`
  - `estimatedRevenue`, `actualRevenue`
  - `createdAt`, `status`
- **Result:** Service couldn't process incomplete tasks
