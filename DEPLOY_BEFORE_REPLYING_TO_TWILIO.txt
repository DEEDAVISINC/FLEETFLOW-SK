URGENT: DEPLOY BEFORE REPLYING TO TWILIO
==========================================

The SMS consent page doesn't exist in production yet - you need to deploy first!

STEP 1: COMMIT AND PUSH
------------------------
cd /Users/deedavis/FLEETFLOW
git add .
git commit -m "Add SMS consent page and tracking for Twilio compliance"
git push origin main

STEP 2: DEPLOY TO DIGITAL OCEAN
---------------------------------
Use your existing deployment process to push to production.

STEP 3: VERIFY IT'S LIVE
-------------------------
Open in browser: https://fleetflowapp.com/sms-consent
Should load WITHOUT requiring login.

If it redirects to login, the middleware update didn't deploy properly.

STEP 4: TAKE SCREENSHOT
------------------------
1. Open https://fleetflowapp.com/sms-consent in your browser
2. Take a full-page screenshot (Cmd+Shift+3 on Mac, or use browser extension)
3. Save as "fleetflow-sms-consent-page.png"

STEP 5: REPLY TO TWILIO
------------------------
Use the email below and attach the screenshot.

ONLY AFTER ALL ABOVE STEPS ARE COMPLETE!
