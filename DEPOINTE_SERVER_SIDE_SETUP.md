# 🚀 DEPOINTE SERVER-SIDE CAMPAIGN EXECUTION - SETUP GUIDE

**Created:** October 13, 2025 **Purpose:** Move campaigns to run 24/7 on server (no browser
required) **Time to Complete:** 15-20 minutes

---

## 🎯 WHAT THIS FIXES

### ❌ OLD SYSTEM (Client-Side):

- Campaigns only run when dashboard is open in browser
- Close browser = campaigns stop = NO LEADS = NO MONEY
- Computer sleep = campaigns stop
- Navigate away from page = campaigns stop
- **Result: 3 DAYS WITHOUT LEADS**

### ✅ NEW SYSTEM (Server-Side):

- Campaigns run 24/7 on server
- Browser can be closed
- Computer can sleep
- Leads generate continuously
- **Result: MONEY WHILE YOU SLEEP** 💰

---

## 📋 SETUP STEPS

### STEP 1: Create Database Tables (5 minutes)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard:**

   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nleqplwwothhxgrovnjw
   ```

2. **Go to SQL Editor** (left sidebar)

3. **Run this SQL:**
   - Open file: `/Users/deedavis/FLEETFLOW/scripts/depointe-campaigns-schema.sql`
   - Copy entire contents
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"

4. **Verify tables created:**

   ```sql
   SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public'
   AND tablename LIKE 'depointe%';
   ```

   Should show:
   - `depointe_campaigns`
   - `depointe_leads`
   - `depointe_activities`

---

### STEP 2: Migrate Existing Campaigns (2 minutes)

**If you have active campaigns in localStorage, migrate them:**

1. **Open DEPOINTE Dashboard:**

   ```
   http://localhost:3001/depointe-dashboard
   ```

2. **Open Browser Console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)

3. **Run this script:**

   ```javascript
   // Gather all localStorage data
   const campaigns = [];
   const leads = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('depointe-crm-leads') || '[]');
   const activities = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('depointe-activity-feed') || '[]');

   // Get healthcare campaigns
   const healthcare = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('depointe-healthcare-tasks') || '[]');
   healthcare.forEach((task) => {
     campaigns.push({
       id: task.id,
       title: task.title,
       description: task.description || '',
       type: task.type || 'healthcare',
       priority: task.priority || 'HIGH',
       assigned_to: task.assignedTo || [],
       status: task.status || 'pending',
       target_quantity: task.targetQuantity || 25,
       progress: task.progress || 0,
       estimated_revenue: task.estimatedRevenue || 125000,
       actual_revenue: task.actualRevenue || 0,
       created_at: task.createdAt || new Date().toISOString(),
       started_at: task.startedAt,
       completed_at: task.completedAt,
       campaign_type: 'healthcare',
     });
   });

   // Get shipper campaigns
   const shipper = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('depointe-shipper-tasks') || '[]');
   shipper.forEach((task) => {
     campaigns.push({
       id: task.id,
       title: task.title,
       description: task.description || '',
       type: task.type || 'shipper',
       priority: task.priority || 'HIGH',
       assigned_to: task.assignedTo || [],
       status: task.status || 'pending',
       target_quantity: task.targetQuantity || 30,
       progress: task.progress || 0,
       estimated_revenue: task.estimatedRevenue || 75000,
       actual_revenue: task.actualRevenue || 0,
       created_at: task.createdAt || new Date().toISOString(),
       started_at: task.startedAt,
       completed_at: task.completedAt,
       campaign_type: 'shipper',
     });
   });

   // Get desperate prospects campaigns
   const desperate = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('depointe-desperate-prospects-tasks') || '[]');
   desperate.forEach((task) => {
     campaigns.push({
       id: task.id,
       title: task.title,
       description: task.description || '',
       type: task.type || 'desperate_prospects',
       priority: task.priority || 'CRITICAL',
       assigned_to: task.assignedTo || [],
       status: task.status || 'pending',
       target_quantity: task.targetQuantity || 20,
       progress: task.progress || 0,
       estimated_revenue: task.estimatedRevenue || 90000,
       actual_revenue: task.actualRevenue || 0,
       created_at: task.createdAt || new Date().toISOString(),
       started_at: task.startedAt,
       completed_at: task.completedAt,
       campaign_type: 'desperate_prospects',
     });
   });

   // Transform leads for database
   const dbLeads = leads.map((lead) => ({
     id: lead.id,
     task_id: lead.taskId,
     company: lead.company,
     contact_name: lead.contactName,
     email: lead.email,
     phone: lead.phone,
     status: lead.status,
     potential_value: lead.potentialValue,
     source: lead.source,
     priority: lead.priority,
     created_at: lead.createdAt,
     assigned_to: lead.assignedTo,
     notes: lead.notes,
   }));

   // Send to migration API
   fetch('/api/depointe/migrate-to-database', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       campaigns,
       leads: dbLeads,
       activities,
     }),
   })
     .then((res) => res.json())
     .then((data) => {
       console.log('✅ Migration complete:', data);
       alert('Migration successful! Check console for details.');
     })
     .catch((err) => {
       console.error('❌ Migration error:', err);
       alert('Migration failed. Check console for errors.');
     });
   ```

4. **Verify migration:**
   ```javascript
   // Check campaigns in database
   fetch('/api/depointe/process-campaigns')
     .then((res) => res.json())
     .then((data) => console.log('Database status:', data));
   ```

### STEP 3: Set Up Cron Job (5 minutes)

**Option A: Simple - Every Minute (Free)**

Use cron-job.org (free, reliable):

1. **Sign up:** https://cron-job.org/en/signup/
2. **Create new cron job:**
   - Title: `DEPOINTE Campaign Processor`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3001/api/cron/process-campaigns`
   - Schedule: `Every 1 minute`
   - Request method: `GET`
   - Add header: `Authorization: Bearer depointe-cron-secret-2025`

3. **Enable job** and verify it runs

**Option B: Advanced - Every 10 Seconds (Paid)**

Use EasyCron.com:

1. **Sign up:** https://www.easycron.com/
2. **Upgrade to paid plan** ($1.99/month for 10-second intervals)
3. **Create cron:**
   - URL: `http://localhost:3001/api/cron/process-campaigns`
   - Interval: `Every 10 seconds`
   - Add header: `Authorization: Bearer depointe-cron-secret-2025`

**Option C: Built-in - Next.js Cron (Best for Production)**

When deploying to DigitalOcean/Vercel:

1. **Add to `.do/app.yaml` or `vercel.json`:**

   ```json
   {
     "crons": [
       {
         "path": "/api/cron/process-campaigns",
         "schedule": "*/10 * * * * *"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Deploy** - cron runs automatically

---

### STEP 4: Add Cron Secret to Environment (1 minute)

```bash
cd /Users/deedavis/FLEETFLOW

echo "CRON_SECRET=depointe-cron-secret-2025" >> .env.local
```

---

### STEP 5: Test Server-Side Execution (2 minutes)

1. **Restart your application:**

   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Manual test - trigger campaign processor:**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/depointe/process-campaigns
   ```

3. **Check status:**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/depointe/process-campaigns
   ```

4. **Expected response:**
   ```json
   {
     "status": "operational",
     "service": "DEPOINTE Campaign Processor (Server-Side)",
     "uptime": "24/7",
     "totalCampaigns": 3,
     "activeCampaigns": 2,
     "completedCampaigns": 1,
     "totalLeads": 45,
     "totalRevenue": 125000
   }
   ```

---

### STEP 6: Verify Campaigns Run Without Browser (CRITICAL TEST)

1. **Open dashboard** to see current status:

   ```
   http://localhost:3001/depointe-dashboard
   ```

2. **Note the current lead count**

3. **CLOSE THE BROWSER** completely

4. **Wait 2 minutes**

5. **Open dashboard again**

6. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Lead count increased
   - ✅ Campaign progress advanced
   - ✅ Activity feed shows new entries
   - ✅ Revenue numbers updated

**If leads increased = SUCCESS! 🎉**

## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS NOW

### Server-Side Flow:

```
1. Cron triggers every 10 seconds
   ↓
2. /api/cron/process-campaigns called
   ↓
3. /api/depointe/process-campaigns executes
   ↓
4. Fetches active campaigns from Supabase
   ↓
5. Generates leads using real APIs:
   - TruckingPlanet (70K+ shippers)
   - FMCSA (carrier database)
   - SAM.gov (government contracts)
   ↓
6. Stores leads in Supabase
   ↓
7. Updates campaign progress
   ↓
8. Logs activity
   ↓
9. Sends emails via SendGrid (if configured)
   ↓
10. Sends SMS via Twilio (if configured)
   ↓
REPEAT EVERY 10 SECONDS (24/7)
```

## 📊 MONITORING

### Check Server Status:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/depointe/process-campaigns
```

### View Recent Activities:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM depointe_activities
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Check Leads Generated:

```sql
SELECT
  campaign_type,
  COUNT(*) as lead_count,
  SUM(potential_value) as total_value
FROM depointe_leads
GROUP BY campaign_type;
```

### Monitor Campaign Progress:

```sql
SELECT
  title,
  status,
  progress,
  actual_revenue,
  estimated_revenue,
  (actual_revenue / NULLIF(estimated_revenue, 0) * 100) as roi_percentage
FROM depointe_campaigns
WHERE status != 'completed'
ORDER BY priority DESC;
```

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "No campaigns found"

**Solution:** Run migration script in Step 2

### Problem: "Cron not triggering"

**Solution:**

- Verify cron service is enabled
- Check authorization header is correct
- Ensure server is running (`npm run dev`)

### Problem: "Database connection failed"

**Solution:**

- Verify Supabase URL in .env.local
- Check Supabase service role key
- Ensure tables exist (run Step 1 again)

### Problem: "No leads generating"

**Solution:**

- Check API keys are configured (Anthropic, TruckingPlanet)
- Verify campaigns have status 'in_progress'
- Check server logs for errors

### Problem: "Leads generating but not showing in dashboard"

**Solution:**

- Dashboard needs to be updated to read from database
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
